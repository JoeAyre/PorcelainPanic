## Description

This is KrapMan: Porcelain Panic – finally, the game you never knew you needed but now can’t live without. 
In this turbo-charged turd of a tale, you play as a courageous little poo with legs, desperately fleeing the porcelain jaws of doom: a sentient, ravenous toilet. 
It’s the high-stakes bathroom break you’ve always dreamed of, only now with power-ups, maze physics, and a splash of unfiltered chaos. 
It's fast, it's frantic, and it smells suspiciously like destiny.

Packed with enough features to clog even the most high-performance console, Porcelain Panic lets you dodge doom through a shifting maze of hydraulic horror. 
Grab a burger for a greasy speed boost (don't ask where it came from), or, if you're playing as the toilet, snag a flush to close the gap with turbo swirl vengeance. 
The maze is littered with toilet paper traps that slow both characters down—because of course it is. 
One-player mode offers seven gut-wrenching levels of difficulty, artfully ranked by the Bristol Stool Chart—from the immovable boulder of Level 1 (aka “Constipocalypse”) to the high-velocity splash-fest that is Level 7. 
Or, double the madness in two-player mode, as two unfortunate souls share one keyboard to outrun—or outflush—each other. When the poo gets caught? You’ll hear the unmistakable cry: “Oh Krap-Man!”
